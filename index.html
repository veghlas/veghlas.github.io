    <h2>Notable achievements</h2>

    <h3>Designed, built and piloted a custom pod racer. 32 BBY Boonta       Eve Classic Race Champion</h3>

    <p class ="paragraph">In my spare time at Wald's Parts junk shop I       designed and built a Class III open
    cockpit Podracer capable of 588 mph top speed. Went on to win the       Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human.         Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the     course of my enslavement.</p>

    <h3>Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Stations construction       projects</h3>

    <p class ="paragraph">During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet       Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects       for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1       SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating Alderaan - a terrestrial           class planet in the Core Worlds region. Successfully tripled the       deep space fire power of the imperial fleet in accordance with         the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away             photon torpedoes.
